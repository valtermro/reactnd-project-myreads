MyReads Project
===============

This is the assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, the first course in the React Developer Nanodegree.

cd reactnd-project-myreads
npm install
npm start
```


Added features
--------------

This project adds the following features to the [project's starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter):

- A new slightly more pleasant template
- The ability to select and move many books at a time
- A custom "Select" component is used as the control to move books. This component tries to mimic some important behaviors of the native `<select>`: it supports keyboard control; and it'll expand itself either up-to-bottom or bottom-to-up depending on how much space is left for it in the viewport
